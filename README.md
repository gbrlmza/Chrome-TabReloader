Chrome-TabReloader
==================

This extension allow you to reload recurrently a given tab with the specified time interval.

The configuration is done via the context menu. No browser-action is used(no extra icon), just a page-action on tabs with active Tab Reloader. The tooltip of the page-action show the scheduled reload and when the icon is clicked, the scheduled reload is canceled.

When a tab is updated by the user or the webpage itself, the countdown starts over.

Tab Realoder remains active on a tab even if the tab's url or domain changes but it will reset the timer.
